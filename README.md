# React Github User Search
This project simplifies the process of exploring GitHub profiles by allowing users to input a specific username. Upon hitting the search button, the application fetches the user's details, including their avatar, username, and captivating bio and link to the profile. Responsive for all types of devices.

Even in case when an entered username does not correspond to an existing GitHub user, the application remains user-focused and shows an error.
